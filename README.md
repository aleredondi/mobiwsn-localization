mobiwsn-localization
====================

##Introduction
This Java project contains the Localization Engine and the Graphical User Interface to be used for the GreenTouch Demo.

Most of the project files can be ignored as they contain code for interfacing with the Wireless Sensor Networks that implements the localization system. The 'important' part is located in the folder /src/client_applications/localization. 

##How to run
The easiest way to run the GUI is to download and unzip the project locally and then import it into Eclipse. 
After that, running the file src/client_applications/localization/LauraManager.java as java application should open the Graphical User Interface.

Note that no localization information will be displayed (and several errors may occur), but it still should be possible to modify the GUI to add what we need. 
The files that control the aspect of the GUI are located in the 'graphics' subpackage.
